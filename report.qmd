# Introduction

In this tutorial, you will refactor the code into separate scripts corresponding to each section. The dataset we will use comes from the `palmerpenguins` package, which contains measurements of penguins from three species.


## Load Libraries and Data
```{python}
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("results/clean_penguins.csv")
print(df.head())
```


# Methods

In this section, we perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and prepare the data for modeling.
![Bill Length boxplot](results/bill_length_boxplot.png){#fig-bill width=50%}

# Model

We will fit a classification model using `tidymodels` to predict the species of a penguin based on its physical characteristics.

```{python}

with open("results/classification_report.txt", "r") as f:
    print(f.read())

```

# Results

We evaluate the performance of the model using the test dataset.


# Conclusion

In this tutorial, we:

- Loaded and cleaned the `palmerpenguins` dataset.
- Performed exploratory data analysis.
- Built a k-Nearest Neighbors classification model using `tidymodels`.
- Evaluated the model's performance.
